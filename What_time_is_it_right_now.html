I don&rsquo;t mean to keep you long but if you have a minute I would really appreciate you seeing this through. The conclusion is simple really, and I hope you can draw this out for yourself.

Pointing along your perception of time the arrow head is you right now. Exciting right? Right here right now you have the opportunity to live a miraculous life.

Which begs the question, What time is it?</span></p><p style='padding:0;margin:0;color:#000000;text-indent:36pt;font-size:11pt;font-family:"Arial";orphans:2;widows:2;height:11pt'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'></span></p><p style='padding:0;margin:0;color:#000000;text-indent:36pt;font-size:11pt;font-family:"Arial";orphans:2;widows:2'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I would be vain to think that anyone will really be musing over my words after I pass, but I would be remiss not to speak as if they were.

Now I know there are a number of you out there who stopped reading when I said that I would tell you what time it is. Some of you are thinking, &ldquo;well, if he gives a number between 0 and 13 the odds aren&rsquo;t too bad&rdquo;, and perhaps a few others are counting up minutes in a day, but that&rsquo;s honestly beyond the point and if we could all just keep reading we could get around to answer to the original question. That is now.

Let&rsquo;s draw another line me. Some time before now I wrote this down. Now you are reading this.

This diagonal line is the idea and it is comprised of some difference in time and space. It is interesting to think of one&rsquo;s self as a point on the horizontal; the point your arrow draws to is you, one of infinite perspectives at a given moment.</span></p><p style='padding:0;margin:0;color:#000000;text-indent:36pt;font-size:11pt;font-family:"Arial";orphans:2;widows:2;height:11pt'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'></span></p><p style='padding:0;margin:0;color:#000000;text-indent:36pt;font-size:11pt;font-family:"Arial";orphans:2;widows:2'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It is that, consideration of the moment beyond self along the vertical. The thin space in which our consciousness exists. The device of empathy. Love exists in this space, between two people in space together at the same time. This consideration of coincidence is beyond any force of newtonian nature. Inexplicably capable, the mind is ironically a hard box to think outside of.</span></p></a><br>
